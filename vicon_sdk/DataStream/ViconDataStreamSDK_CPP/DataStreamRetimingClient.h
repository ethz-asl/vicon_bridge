    ///  \class RetimingClient 
    ///  \brief The re-timing client class for C++.
    ///  Vicon DataStream SDK Re-Timing Client
    ///  ===========================
    ///  Intended uses
    ///  -------------
    ///  The Vicon DataStream re-timing client provides calls to obtain subject data from the 
    ///  DataStream with minimal latency and temporal jitter. 
    ///  When UpdateFrame() is called, the client uses re-timed data that has been linearly interpolated 
    ///  from an internal buffer to predict the position of each segment to the current time. 
    ///
    ///  The system and network latencies are used when determining the amount of prediction required.
    ///  If additional prediction is required, for example, for use in a VR system where an additional latency 
    ///  is present due to rendering and display latency; this may be requested in the call to UpdateFrame().
    ///
    ///  The user will call UpdateFrame(), which will update the current frame state to 
    ///  the time of calling and return immediately. This is intended for use in systems where you require
    ///  subject data positions at times driven by an external clock.
    ///
    ///  If you do not have an external clock, and require behavior similar to that of the standard DataStream 
    ///  client running in ServerPush streaming mode, then the system may be configured to provide frame data
    ///  at a consistent frame rate by providing a frame rate to the Connect() call. The user will then call 
    ///  WaitForFrame(), which will block in a similar method to Client::GetFrame(), but using retimed data
    ///  in order to keep the frame period very consistent.
    /// 
    ///  Examples of use
    ///  --------------
    /// 
    ///  If you are using the client in a situation where you need to obtain the position of subjects  
    ///

    ///       // them to a model, so this code would iterate over the model and update the joint positions.
    ///       void render() 
    ///       {
